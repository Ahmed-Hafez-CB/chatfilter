# 📛 ChatFilter - Clean Your Chat from Server Spam

**ChatFilter** is a lightweight [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) client-side mod for Minecraft 1.21.5 that improves your chat by blocking spammy server messages — such as `[Broadcast]`, `[Crates]`, and other noisy automated announcements.

🛠️ Created specifically for **Invaded Lands Minecraft Server**, but works on **any** server that uses those chat formats.
